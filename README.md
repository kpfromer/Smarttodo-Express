# smarttodo-express

I am writing the smarttodo backend (which was in nestjs, built on top of express) in express due
to the fact that nestjs is limiting, more difficult to use and less modular.

With express I can dynamically create routes which makes testing a heck of a lot easier (and development faster)!
